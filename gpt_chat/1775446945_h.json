Among these activities, online gaming is one of the games that helps to entertain and relieve pressure. However, playing too many online games can have a negative impact on the player's health and mental well-being.\n\nPlaying too many electronic games can lead to a decline in health. Focusing on playing a game continuously for hours can cause eye strain and affect vision. In some cases, players may even skip meals to play games, which can harm their digestive system. Regularly playing games can reduce the amount of time spent sleeping, leading to fatigue and exhaustion.\n\nMoreover, playing too many online games can also affect mental health. Players may feel tired, lack energy, or have difficulty resting due to prolonged and continuous game playing. They may lose interest in other hobbies and activities, and everything may become focused on the game. Players may become easily irritable and prone to anger, even over small matters.\n\nIn summary, playing too many online games can be harmful to both physical and mental health.
