For example, in the relation `R(A, B, C)`, the functional dependency `A \u2192 B` means that each value of `A` uniquely determines a value of `B`.\n\nTo find the keys of a functional dependency, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the essential attributes. An essential attribute is an attribute that is not determined by any other attribute. In the relation `R(A, B, C)`, the essential attributes are `A` and `B`.\n2. Find the closure of each essential attribute. The closure of an attribute is the set of all attributes that are determined by that attribute. In the relation `R(A, B, C)`, the closure of `A` is `A, B, C` and the closure of `B` is `B, C`.\n3. The keys of the functional dependency are the minimal sets of attributes whose closure is the entire relation. In the relation `R(A, B, C)`, the keys are `A` and `B`.\n\nHere is an example of how to find the keys of a functional dependency:\n\n\nGiven the functional dependency `A \u2192 B, C` on the relation `R(A, B, C)`, we can find the keys as follows:\n\n1. The essential attributes are `A` and `B`.\n2. The closure of `A` is `A, B, C`.\n3. The closure of `B` is `B, C`.\n4. The minimal sets of attributes whose closure is the entire relation are `A` and `B`.\n\nTherefore, the keys of the functional dependency `A \u2192 B, C` are `A` and `B`.\n"]}, {"id": "rc_edfdc2116cece09", "content": ["To find the keys of a functional dependency, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the essential attributes.** These are the attributes that are not determined by any other attributes.\n2. **Find the closure of each essential attribute.** The closure of an attribute is the set of all attributes that can be determined by that attribute.\n3. **Any set of attributes that is the closure of an essential attribute is a key.**\n\nFor example, consider the following functional dependencies:\n\n* A \u2192 B\n* B \u2192 C\n* C \u2192 D\n\nThe essential attributes are A and B.
